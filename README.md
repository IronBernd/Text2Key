# Text2Key
Very simple AutoIT Skript that simulate keyboard input.

Users needs only the executable file 

This is a beta Version. 

This skript sends the text from the input box key by key to the previous active window.  
This is helpfull if the copy/paste funktion is not available for the Window.

ToDo: 
  * Dokumentation of the Excel Sheet
  * Read break and worktime from Config sheet.
